question1
answer: because different exceptions/interrupts have different solutions to solve it. without that, we can not easily provide protection.

quesiton2
answer: we should set the DPL to 3 to let users invoke int $14, but this wll let user interfere with memory management.

question3
answer: because we set DPL of T_BRKPT to 0 and we use int $3 in breakpoint, we got the general protection fault. we need to set DPL = 3 for breakpoint trap handler to work correctly.

question4
answer: protection to prevent user from invoking interrupt handlers and interfering with kernel.
